MusicBot is the original Discord music bot written for JavaScript 14, using the 
library. It plays requested songs from YouTube and other services into a Discord server (or multiple servers). Besides, if the queue becomes empty MusicBot will play through a list of existing songs with configuration. The bot features a permission system allowing owners to restrict commands to certain people. As well as playing songs.
